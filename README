# Spritesheet Generator

This is an attempt at generating a spritesheet from a Photoshop file.

The script can be installed by copy-ing this file into Presets/Scripts in your Photoshop Install Directory
f.x. C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\<Your Photoshop version>\Presets\Scripts

This has only been tested on PS CS2.

It assumes that each layer that is supposed to be added to the spritesheet has the string "sprite" in its name.
